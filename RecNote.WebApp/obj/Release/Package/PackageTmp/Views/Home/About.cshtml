        The recnote application was originally conceived from a neccessity felt for recording, controlling and easy retrieval of household
        daily expenses such as all the bills that are paid at regular intervals. The idea was to get a quick recall of the all the expenses paid from one
        single place. This gets rid of the endless searching of online or printed records to get the required piece of information.

        The website also provides a single place for recording and management of  the household maintenance related expenses. This includes electrical,
        plumbing, carpet cleaning, gutter cleaning as well as car related expenses.

        The third application is about information regarding all the domestic insurance policies(includes medical, home, content, life and car) that it
        maintains so well.

        Finally, the website can also be used as a Contact Manager for maintaining details about important contacts which can be retrieved by a single click.

        In summary, this is a one stop shop for managing all the information about common expenses encountered by a household.
