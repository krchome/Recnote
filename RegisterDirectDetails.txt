Your Unique Domain Authentication ID (UDAI) for this domain name is:
   UDAI: CF7Ud9PU

The Unique Domain Authentication Identification (UDAI) is required to enable
a transfer of your domain name from one registrar to another. If you are
asked to provide the UDAI for anything other than this you should query the
request. With the introduction of .nz registrations at the second level some
registrants will require the UDAI as part of their Preferential Registration
Eligibility.

The provided UDAI will expire in 30 days of the date of this email, or when
a transfer is initiated, whichever comes first.

Manage custom domains

You can point custom domain names to your Windows Azure websites. Windows Azure must verify that you are authorized to configure the custom domain name to point to your Windows Azure website. To verify authorization, create a CNAME resource record with your DNS provider that points from either www.yourdomain.com to RecNoteWebApp.azurewebsites.net, or from awverify.www.yourdomain.com to awverify.RecNoteWebApp.azurewebsites.net. When using Traffic Manager, create a CNAME resource record with your DNS provider that points to the *.trafficmanager.net URL.
